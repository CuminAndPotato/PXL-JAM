# 🎄 **Welcome to the PXL Challenge!** 🎄

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following set up:

**Mandatory**

- [**.NET 8 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

**Optional (Recommended)**

- [**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [**Ionide-fsharp Extension for VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)

**Fork the Repository**

Best practice is to fork this repository to your GitHub account. This way, you can experiment with the code and save your changes, and maybe there will be some surprises along the way. 🎁

**Prepare Your Sprites**

- Check out the sprites 🖼️ in `./PxlApps/assets` (like `pizzaMampf.png`) and swap them with your own custom artwork to personalize your app.

## 🚀 Start the Simulator

Before running any apps, you’ll need to start the simulator.

⚠️ **Important:** Only one simulator should be running at a time.

1. Open the list of build tasks in VSCode:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+B` (macOS).
2. Select **Start Simulator** from the list.

As an alternative for the VSCode build task, just run `./start-simulator.sh` in your terminal.

## Run an App

Explore the demo apps and tutorials in the `./PxlApps` directory.

**Steps to Run an App:**

1. Ensure the simulator is running (see above).
2. Open an app file (e.g. `./PxlApps/RoundClock.fsx`) in VSCode.
3. Select the entire content of the file and run it by pressing `Alt+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (macOS).

🎉 Enjoy experimenting!

You can modify the code, open new files, and re-run apps as often as you like. Simply re-evaluate the **entire file** (that's the mose easy way.)

Want to create your own apps? Use the examples as a starting point, and let your imagination run wild!

🌟 Thank You for Being a Part of This Journey!
