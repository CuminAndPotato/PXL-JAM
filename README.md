## Hands On!

To programm PXL-Apps, you need to set up your development environment. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

### Prerequisites

**Mandatory**

- [**.NET 8 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

**Optional (Recommended)**

- [**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [**Ionide-fsharp Extension for VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)

### Fork the Repository

Best practice is to fork this repository to your GitHub account. This way, you can experiment with the code and save your changes, and maybe there will be some surprises along the way. üéÅ

### Prepare the Sprites

Check out the sprites üñºÔ∏è in `./PxlApps/assets` (like `pizzaMampf.png`) and swap them with your own custom artwork to personalize your app.

### Create Your First App

A PXL-App consists of two parts:
   - one or more F# script (or many of them) that contain the code for your app,
   - optionally some assets like images.

To set up your first app, follow these steps:

- Under the `./PxlApps/04_Submissions` folder, create a file with your GitHub account name and the name of your app

  Pattern: `{GHAccountName}_{UniqueAppName}.fsx`

  Example: `SchlenkR_MyFirstApp.fsx`

You can just copy and rename the example file `./PxlApps/04_Submissions/SchlenkR_MyFirstApp.fsx` to get started.

- If you have any assets (images), put them in the folder `./PxlApps/assets/submissions`- and name them:
  
  Pattern: `{GHAccountName}_{UniqueAppName}...`
  
  Example: `SchlenkR_MyImage.png`

### üöÄ Start the Simulator

Before running any apps, you‚Äôll need to start the simulator.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Only one simulator should be running at a time.

1. Open the list of build tasks in VSCode:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+B` (macOS).
2. Select **Start Simulator** from the list.

As an alternative for the VSCode build task, just run `./start-simulator.sh` (Mac) or `./start-simulator.ps1` (Windows) in your terminal.

### Run an App

- Ensure the simulator is running (see above).
- Open your app file in the editor (works as well with all samples and tutorials here in this repo).
- Select the entire content of the file and run it by pressing `Alt+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac).

You can modify the code, open new files, and re-run apps as often as you like. Simply re-evaluate the **entire file** (that's the mose easy way.)

In case the simulator does not what you expect (e.g. you were in sleep mode), just restart the simulator.

### Submit Your App

When you‚Äôre ready to submit your app, create a pull request (PR) with your changes. We‚Äôll review your app, provide feedback or merge it.

Follow-up PRs (updates) for your app in case you want to improve it are welcome until the end of the PXL-JAM 2024.
