## Prerequisites

**Mandatory:**

- dotnet 8 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

**Optional (recommended):**

- VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- VSCode Extension: Ionide-fsharp (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)

## Prepare Sprites

Have a look at `./src/assets/pizzaMampf.png` **and all other sprites** and replace the sprite with your own.

## Start the Simulator

When playing around, the simulator has to be started.

**There must be exactly one simulator running at a time.**

Start it by either using VSCode or the command line:

- Using VSCode

    - Open the list of build tasks by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+B` (macOS).
    - Select `Start Simulator` from the list of build tasks.

**OR**

- Command Line

    In a terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./start-simulator.sh
    ```

## Start an App

All demo apps and tutorials are located in the `./PxlApps` directory.

Run an app by:

- make sure the simulator is running (see above)

then:

- open a file (e.g. `./PxlApps/RoundClock.fsx`) in VSCode
- select the complete content and press `Alt+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) to run the app.

You can now change code or open another file and repeat the process.

**You can always re-evaluate a complete file, including all dependencies**
