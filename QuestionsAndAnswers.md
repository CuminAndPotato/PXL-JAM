## Questions & Answers (part of Terms & Conditions)

**Q: I have no idea what a repository, GitHub, or VSCode is. Can I still participate?**

Absolutely! Don’t let that discourage you. This is your chance to learn programming using modern, professional techniques. We’ve compiled a list of resources, including tutorials and examples, to help you get started. You can also team with experienced developers to make this a pair programming experience with joy :)

Feel free to ask others for help—don’t be shy! The community is here to support you.

**Q: Are there any fixed categories for submissions?**

You’re free to experiment and create whatever you like! Here are some ideas to spark your imagination:

- Algorithmic Drawings
- AI Playing Games: Side scrollers, Snake, Asteroids, etc.
- Apps: Weather, news, or any creative idea you have.
- Storytelling: Create small, silent film-like stories or explore new formats.
- UI Widgets: Sliding scenes or innovative interfaces.
- Particle Physics Simulations: Show that particle physics is exciting and fun!

For more inspiration, check out the [raw list of ideas](Ideas.md) in our repository.

**Q: Can I participate anonymously?**

Yes, to an extent. While your GitHub account will be publicly visible when you submit a pull request, we will keep your personal information private. We’ll need your address to send you a PXL-Clock if you win, but this information won’t be shared publicly.

**Q: Who will be on the jury?**

We haven’t finalized the jury yet, but it will likely consist of friends and family—a mix of people we love and trust for their honesty and diverse perspectives.

**Q: Can I submit more than one app?**

Yes! You can submit as many apps as you like (further info: a single individual can only win 1 PXL-CLock - we trust in Your fairness.)

**Q: How will the submissions be evaluated?**

The jury will evaluate submissions based on their personal preferences, considering factors like creativity, technical merit, storytelling, and artistic expression.

**Q: How many PXL-Clocks will be awarded?**

We will give away three PXL-Clocks to the winners.

**Q: Can the programs accept input from the user?**

No, the programs must run autonomously without user interaction.

**Q: Which libraries or programming techniques can I use?**

- You can make HTTP calls upfront (not inside a scene).
- Loading images included with your app is allowed upfront (not inside a scene).
- Access to external hardware is not permitted - unless via HTTP if it’s publicly available.

**Q: In which countries can I participate?**

You can participate from anywhere in the world, but we will ship the PXL-Clocks only within the European Union (EU).

**Q: What are the conditions to participate?**

In addition to this Q&A section, please review the Terms and Conditions section below and check out our repository for detailed participation guidelines.

**Q: Can I buy a PXL-Clock if I don’t win one?**

Yes! This will be possible soon. Stay tuned by following us on Bluesky or similar platforms, and keep an eye on our repository for the latest announcements.

**Q: Can I collaborate with others?**

Absolutely! While there’s no official collaboration platform, here are some suggestions:

- Post on Bluesky or other social channels using the #pxlclock hashtag during the challenge to connect with others.
- Check who has forked the repository and consider reaching out for collaboration.

**Q: Do I need a GitHub account?**

Yes, you’ll need a GitHub account to submit your creations via a pull request.
